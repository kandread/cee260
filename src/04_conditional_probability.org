* Statistical independence
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  $$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$
  #+reveal_html: </span>
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$$
  $$\Rightarrow P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)$$

** Independence of multiple events
   The events $E_1$, $E_2$,...,$E_n$ are /independent/ if and only if
   $$P(E_1 \cap E_2 \cap ... \cap E_n)=P(E_1) \times P(E_2) \times ... \times P(E_n)$$
* Conditional probability

  $$P(B|A)=\dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$$

* Multiplication rule

  $$P(A \cap B) = P(B|A)P(A)=P(A|B)P(B)$$

* Rules for conditional probabilities
  Addition and multiplication rules work the same way
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  $$P(E_1 \cup E_2 | A) = P(E_1|A) + P(E_2|A) - P(E_1 \cap E_2 | A)$$
  #+reveal_html: </span>
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  $$P(E_1 \cap E_2 | A) = P(E_1|E_2|A)P(E_2|A)$$

   - Given that a civilian was shot, it was found that there is a higher chance of being white (0.64 vs 0.36)
   - What is wrong with $P \left( \text{civilian race} | \text{shot} \right)$?
   - Imagine police encounter civilians with 90 white and 10 POC  
   - 5 POC and 9 white civilians are shot
   - $P\left( \text{shot} | \text{civilian race} \right)$

* Problem 4.1

  if a link's fracture strength is less than 300 kg, it will fail. Probability of failure of either link is 0.05. What is the probability that the chain system fails?
* Problem 4.2
  There is a 1% chance of hazardous material leaking from site X. Either of towns A and B would get contaminated water if there is leakage and there exists a continuous seam of sand. Probability of seam to A and B is 2% and 3% respectively. If a seam exists between X and A, the probability of a seam between X and B increases to 20%. Assume that leakage and presence of seams of sand are independent.
