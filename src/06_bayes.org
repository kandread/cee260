  - Statistical inference
  - Frequentist vs Bayesian
  - Example of the color for 24 circles
  - "If you pick a random circle, 75% chance that it is blue although it could be 74% or 76%"
  - "I am 99% confident that there are 18 blue circles"

** But what is the equation?
   #+reveal_html: <div class="fragment block">
   $$P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}$$

   $P(B): \textbf{evidence}$, $P(A|B): \textbf{posterior}$, $P(A): \textbf{prior}$, $P(B|A): \textbf{likelihood}$

** A classic example
   Bottom slider is the probability of having the disease, top slider is the accuracy of the test

** Back to equations
   $$P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \Rightarrow P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) P(B)$$
   #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
   $$P(B|A) = \dfrac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} \Rightarrow P(A \cap B) = P(B|A) P(A)$$   
   #+reveal_html: </span>
   #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
   $$P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A) \Rightarrow P(A|B)=\dfrac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

* Problem 5.2
  80% probability that mix from concrete plant is of good quality. Tests on site for compressive strength are performed, but test has 90% reliability: a good-quality mix ($G$) will pass test ($T$) with 0.9 probability and a poor-quality mix will pass with 0.1 probability. 
** {{{empty}}}
   What is the probability that mix is of good quality if it passes the QC test?
** {{{empty}}}
   Suppose a second sample is tested after the first, what is the probability that the mix is of good quality? 
** {{{empty}}}
   Let's perform these two calculations in a single step.
** {{{empty}}}
   What if either one of the tests was negative?
* A more general equation
  #+reveal_html: <div class="fragment block">
  If $E_1,E_2,...,E_k$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events and $B$ is any event with $PB)>0$
  $$P(E_1|B) = \dfrac{P(B|E_1)P(E_1)}{P(B|E_1)P(E_1)+...+P(B|E_k)P(E_k)}$$

* Problem 5.3
  Amount of materials at a construction site is either 100 or 200 units with respective probabilities of 0.6 and 0.4. If the amount of material required in a day is 100, probability of shortage is 0.1, whereas if the requirement is 200 the probability of shortage is 0.3.
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - What is the probability of shortage on a given day? ({{{color(cornflowerblue,0.18)}}})
  - If there is a shortage, what is the probability of the requirement being 100 units? ({{{color(cornflowerblue,1/3)}}})
