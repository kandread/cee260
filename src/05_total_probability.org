* Total probability rule
  Sometimes we know the probability of an event given other conditions

** Total probability rule (multiple events)
   Assume $E_1$, $E_2$,...,$E_k$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive sets. Then
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   $$P(B) = P(B \cap E_1) + P(B \cap E_2) + ... + P(B \cap E_k)$$
   $$P(B) = P(B|E_1)P(E_1)+P(B|E_2)P(E_2)+ ... + P(B|E_k)P(E_k)$$

* Problem 4.3
  Successful completion ($C$) of a project depends on supply of materials, labor, and weather:
  - Good weather ($G$) and at least labor ($L$) or material ($M$) available
  - Bad weather but both labor and material available
  Suppose $P(L)=0.7$, $P(G)=0.6$, and $L$ is independent of both $M$ and $G$.
  - If the weather is good, adequate supply of materials is certain.
  - If weather is bad, probability of materials is 50%.

   Describe the event of successful completion in terms of $G$, $L$, and $M$

   Determine the probability of successful completion

   If the project completes successfully, what is the probability that labor supply had been inadequate?

  - High-wind storms in the county occur once every other year
  - During such a storm probability of tornadoes is 0.25
  - Probability of tornadoes in the county striking the town is 0.15
  - Probability of damages during wind storm with no tornadoes is 0.05
  - If tornadoes do not strike the town, probability of damages is 0.10
  - Damages are certain if tornadoes strike the town
