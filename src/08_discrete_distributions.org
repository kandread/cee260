* Probability distributions for discrete variables
  - Uniform
  - Binomial
  - Geometric
  - Negative binomial
  - Poisson
  - Hypergeometric
* Uniform distribution
  #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
  A random variable $X$ has a *discrete uniform distribution* if each of the $n$ values in its range, $x_1$, $x_2$, ..., $x_n$ has equal probability
  $$f(x_i) = \dfrac{1}{n}$$

  $X$ with values in $R=\{0,1,2,...,9\}$

** Mean and variance
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   If $X$ is a discrete uniform variable with integer values $a$, $a+1$, ..., $b$ for $a \leq b$, then
   $$\mu=E(X)=\dfrac{b+a}{2}$$
   $$\sigma^2=\dfrac{(b-a+1)^2-1}{12}$$

* Bernoulli sequence
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - When allocating fleet of construction equipment, their expected condition over the duration of the project would determine the required fleet size
  - When planning a flood control system, the annual maximum flow magnitude relative to a flood threshold would determine system sizing

** Bernoulli sequence properties
   1. In each trial, there are only two possibilities: {{{color(skyblue,occurrence (success))}}} and {{{color(orangered,non-occurrence (failure))}}}
   2. Probability of occurrence of the event in each trial is constant
   3. The trials are statistically independent
* Binomial distribution
  - A random variable $X$ that describes the number of occurrences of an event among $n$ trials
  - The probability of occurrence of the event for each trial is $p$
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  $$f(x) = \binom{n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x}$$

  $$\binom{n}{x} = \dfrac{n!}{x!(n-x)!}$$

  The CDF of the binomial distribution is $$F(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{x} \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$

** Example
   Each water sample has 10% chance of containing a pollutant. What is the probability that the next 18 samples, exactly 2 will contain the pollutant?
   #+reveal: split
   Determine the probability that at least 4 samples contain the pollutant.
** Mean and variance
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   If $X$ is a binomial variable with parameters $p$ and $n$, then
   $$\mu=E(X)=np$$
   $$\sigma^2=V(X)=np(1-p)$$
   #+reveal_html: </div>
* Geometric distribution
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - Assume series of Bernoulli trials
  - Constant probability of success $p$
  - Instead of a fixed number of trials, *trials are conducted until success is obtained*
  - $X$ is the random variable describing number of trials until first success
  #+reveal: split
  #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
  In a series of Bernoulli trials, the random variable $X$ that equals the number of trials until the first success is a geometric random variable with parameter $0 < p < 1$ and $$f(x)=(1-p)^{x-1}p$$
  #+reveal_html: </div>
** Return period
   #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
   - Time intervals until first occurrence of an event can be described as a set of Bernoulli trials
   - Time between two occurrences is also a geometric distribution (*recurrence time*)
   
   #+reveal_html: <div class="fragment block">
   Return period is the mean recurrence time between two occurrences, and is given by
   $$\overline{T} = \dfrac{1}{p}$$

** Mean and variance
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   If $X$ is a geometric random variable with parameter $p$, then
   $$\mu=E(X)=\dfrac{1}{p}$$
   $$\sigma^2=V(X)=\dfrac{1-p}{p^2}$$
   #+reveal_html: </div>
* Negative binomial distribution
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  A generalization of the geometric distribution where the random variable $X$ describes *the number of Bernoulli trials required to obtain $r$ successes*

  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  - Probability that $r-1$ successes in the first $x-1$ trials is $$\binom{x-1}{r-1}p^{r-1}(1-p)^{x-r}$$
  - Probability that trial $x$ is a success is $p$
  #+reveal_html: </span>
  #+reveal: split
  #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
  In a series of Bernoulli trials (independent trials with constant probability $p$ of a success), the random variable $X$ that equals the number of trials until $r$ successes occur is a negative binomial random variable with parameters $0 < p < 1$ and $r = 1, 2, 3, ...$
  $$f(x) = \binom{x-1}{r-1}(1-p)^{x-r}p^r$$
  where $x=r,r+1,r+2,...$
  #+reveal_html: </div>
** Mean and variance
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   If $X$ is a negative binomial random variable with parameters $p$ and $r$, then
   $$\mu=E(X)=\dfrac{r}{p}$$
   $$\sigma^2=V(X)=\dfrac{r(1-p)}{p^2}$$

* Problem 8.1
  A fixed offshore platform is designed for a wave height of 8 m above the mean sea level. This wave height corresponds to a 5% probability of being exceeded per year.
  #+reveal: split
  What is the probability that the platform will be subjected to the design height within the return period?
  #+reveal: split
  What is the probability that the first exceedance of the design height will occur after year 3?
  #+reveal: split
  If the first exceedance of the design height occurs after year 3, what is the probability that it will occur in year 5?
* Problem 8.2
  The code for the design of a building in a coastal region specifies the 50-yr wind as the "design wind". What is the probability that a newly completed building is subjected to the design wind for the first time on the fifth year after completion?
  #+reveal: split
  What is the probability that it is subjected /within/ 5 years after completion?
  #+reveal: split
  What is the probability that it is subjected to the design wind for the third time 10 years after completion?
