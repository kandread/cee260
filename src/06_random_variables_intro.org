* Random variables
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - Sample space and events for simple cases: outcomes
  - Sometimes we need an analytical form to describe these
  - Variable that associates outcomes with real numbers

  #+reveal_html: <div class="fragment block">
  A random variable is a function that assigns a real number to each outcome in the sample space of a random experiment
  #+reveal_html: </div>
** Notation
   $$X: \text{random variable}$$
   $$x: \text{value of random variable}$$

   #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
   Any event can be expressed as $X=a$, or $X \leq a$, or $a < X \leq b$

* Discrete and Continuous random variables
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - Discrete and continuous sample space
  - *Discrete random variable*
    - random variable with a finite (or countably infinite) range
  - *Continuous random variable*
    - random variable with an interval (either finite or infinite) of real numbers for its range
  - Sometimes a variable is discrete but it's more convenient to treat it as continuous
** Examples of random variables
   #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
   - Electrical current
   - Length
   - Pressure
   - Number of surface scratches
   - Proportion of defective parts among 1000 tested
* Readings
  - Section 2.8
  - Section 2.9
