  - If A and B are statistically independent, then P(A|B)=0.
  - If P(A|B)=0.2 and A, B are statistically independent, what is P(A)?
  - The total probability rule can only be used with mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.
  - What do you absolutely need to know to calculate the probability $P(A \cap B)$?
  - What is the probability $P[(A \cap B) \cap (C' \cap A')|A]$?
* Recap
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - Bernoulli sequence
  - Binomial distribution
    - Number of successes for fixed number of $n$ trials
  - Geometric distribution
    - Number of trials for first success to occur
  - Negative binomial
    - Number of trails for $r$ successes to occur
* Poisson process
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - Occurrence of events at any point in space and/or time
    - Earthquakes could strike anywhere at any time in an active region
    - Fatigue cracks can occur anywhere along a continuous weld
  - Bernoulli trials could be used but are limited
  - /Poisson process/ (or sequence)
** Example
   - Flaws occur at random along the length of a thin copper wire
   - $X$ is the number of flaws in a length of $T$ millimeters of wire
   - Suppose that the average number of flaws per millimeter is $\lambda$

   #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
   $$E(X)=\lambda T$$
   #+reveal_html: </span>
   #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
   Partition the length of the wire into $n$ intervals of small length $\Delta t=T/n$
   #+reveal_html: </span>
   #+reveal: split
   - If intervals small enough, probability that more than one flaws occurs in each is negligible
   - Flaws occur at random = same probability of flaw ($p$)
   - Occurrence of flaw in interval independent of other intervals
   #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
   Approximate with binomial $$E(X)=\lambda T = n p \Rightarrow p = \dfrac{\lambda T}{n}$$
   $$P(X=x) \approx \binom{n}{x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x}$$
   #+reveal_html: </span>
   #+reveal: split
   $$\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} P(X=x) = \dfrac{e^{\lambda T}(\lambda T)^x}{x!}$$
   #+reveal_html: <div class="fragment block">
   A random experiment with subintervals of very small length $\Delta t$, and
   1. Probability of more than one event in a subinterval tends to zero
   2. The probability of one event in a subinterval tends to $\lambda \Delta t$
   3. The event in each subinterval is independent of  other subintervals
   is a *Poisson process*
   #+reveal_html: </div>
** Poisson distribution
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   The random variable $X$ that equals the number of events in a Poisson process is a *Poisson random variable* with parameter $\lambda > 0$, and
   $$f(x)=\dfrac{e^{-\lambda T}(\lambda T)^x}{x!}$$

** Example
   Historical records of severe storms over last 20 years indicate there were an average of 4 storms per year. Assuming that storms are modeled as Poisson process, what is the probability that there would be no storms next year?
   #+reveal: split
   What is the probability of 4 storms next year?
   #+reveal: split
   What is the probability of two or more storms next year?
** Bernoulli vs Poisson
   In the last 50 years, there have been two major ($M \geq 6$) earthquakes in California. What is the probability of such a large earthquake in the next 15 years if we model them as Bernoulli or Poisson sequence?
** Problem 9.1
   A steel pipeline that transports crude oil over a distance of 100 km, is subject to damaging corrosion. From past annual inspection, the average distance between locations of such corrosion is 0.15/km. The occurrence of corrosion is modeled as a Poisson process. What is the probability that there will be 10 locations of corrosion between inspections?
   #+reveal: split
   What is the probability of at least 5 corrosion sites between inspections?
** Mean and variance
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   If $X$ is a Poisson random variable over an interval of length $T$ with parameter $\lambda$, then
   $$\mu = E(X) = \lambda T$$
   $$\sigma^2 = V(X) = \lambda T$$

* Hypergeometric distribution
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - 850 manufactured parts contain 50 non-conforming to customer specs
  - Two parts are selected at random without replacement
  - $A$ and $B$ are events that first and second parts are non-conforming
  - $P(A)=50/850$
  - $P(B|A)=49/849$
  #+reveal: split
  Let $X$ be the number of non-conforming parts
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  $$P(X=0)=P(\text{both parts conform})=\dfrac{800}{850}\dfrac{799}{849}=0.886$$
  #+reveal_html: </span>
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  $$P(X=1)=\dfrac{800}{850}\dfrac{50}{849} + \dfrac{50}{850}\dfrac{849}=0.111$$
  #+reveal_html: </span>
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  $$P(X=2)=\dfrac{50}{850}\dfrac{49}{849}=0.003$$
  #+reveal_html: </span>
** Hypergeometric distribution
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   A set of $N$ objects contains $K$ successes and $N-K$ failures. A sample of size $n$ objects is selected randomly. The random variable $X$ that equals the number of successes in the sample is a *hypergeometric random variable* and $$f(x)=\dfrac{\binom{K}{x}\binom{N-K}{n-x}}{\binom{N}{n}}$$
   #+reveal_html: </div>
** Mean and variance
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   If $X$ is a hypergeometric random variable with parameters $N$, $K$, and $n$, then
   $$\mu=E(X)=np$$ $$\sigma^2=V(X)=np(1-p)\left( \dfrac{N-n}{N-1} \right)$$
