- Test on mean, variance known
  - $H_0: \mu=\mu_0$ and $H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$
  - $Z_0=\dfrac{\overline{X}-\mu_0}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$
- Type II error
  - $\beta \approx \Phi \left( z_{\alpha/2} - \dfrac{\delta \sqrt{n}}{\sigma} \right)$
- Test on mean, variance unknown
  - $H_0: \mu=\mu_0$ and $H_1: \mu \neq \mu_0$
  - $T_0 = \dfrac{\overline{X}-\mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$
* Tests on population proportion
#+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
- Many engineering problems concern a random variable from a binomial distribution
- Suppose a random sample of size $n$ is taken from a large population
- $X(\leq n)$ observations belong to class of interest
- $\hat{P}=X/n$ is a point estimator
* Large-sample test on a proportion

- Null hypothesis is $H_0: p=p_0$
- Alternative hypothesis is $H_1: p \neq p_0$
- Sampling distribution of $\hat{P}$ is approximately normal with mean $p$ and variance $p(1-p)/n$
- Approximation works if $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are $\geq 5$

** Example
A semiconductor manufacturer produces controllers used in car engines. The customer requires that the fraction of defective items not exceed 0.05 and the manufacturer demonstrate this quality level at $\alpha=0.05$. The manufacturer takes a sample of 200 units and finds 4 defective. Can the manufacturer demonstrate process capability for the customer?
* Type II error
#+reveal_html: <div class="block">
$$\beta = \Phi \left( \dfrac{p_0 - p + z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}}{\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}} \right)$$
$$ - \Phi \left( \dfrac{p_0 - p - z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}}{\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}} \right)$$

** Approximate sample size for a two-sided test
#+reveal_html: <div class="block">
$$n = \left[ \dfrac{z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)} + z_{\beta}\sqrt{p(1-p)}}{p_p_0} \right]^2$$
#+reveal_html: </div>
** Approximate sample size of a one-sided test
#+reveal_html: <div class="block">
$$n = \left[ \dfrac{z_{\alpha}\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)} + z_{\beta}\sqrt{p(1-p)}}{p_p_0} \right]^2$$
#+reveal_html: </div>
** Example
From the previous example about the semiconductor manufacturer. Suppose the defective fraction is really $p=0.03$. What is the $\beta$ error for a process that uses $n=200$ and $\alpha=0.05$?
#+reveal: split
What is the required sample size of the manufacturer is willing to accept a $\beta$ error as large as 0.10?
* What if we don't know the underlying distribution?
#+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
We have a sample and an assumed distribution. Can we test whether the chosen distribution is satisfactory as a population model?

*Goodness-of-fit*
#+reveal_html: </span>
* The Chi-square test for goodness-of-fit
- A sample of size $n$ is obtained and the values are arranged in $k$ bins
- Similar to probability plots, the test will compare the observed frequencies with the theoretical frequencies (if the chosen distribution is the correct one)
- $O_i$ are the observed frequencies for each bin and $E_i$ is the expected (or theoretical) frequency
#+reveal: split
We can derive a statistic that follows the $\chi^2$ distribution
  #+reveal_html: <div class="fragment block">
  $$\chi_0^2 = \sum_{i=1}^k \dfrac{(O-i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$
  with $k-p-1$ degrees of freedom
  #+reveal_html: </div>
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  We would reject $H_0$ if $\chi_0^2 > \chi_{\alpha,k-p-1}^2$
  #+reveal_html: </span>
** Example
The number of defects in printed circuit boards is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. A random sample of $n=60$ boards has been collected with the following results
| Number of defects | Observed Frequency |
|-------------------+--------------------|
|                 0 |                 32 |
|                 1 |                 15 |
|                 2 |                  9 |
|                 3 |                  4 |
Is the Poisson an appropriate distribution?
