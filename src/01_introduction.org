  /What about uncertainty?/
* Uncertainty
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
  - Randomness with the underlying process that is exhibited as variability
  - *{{{color(skyblue3,Aleatory)}}}* uncertainty
  - Inherent in nature and cannot be reduced
  - Imperfect or insufficient models of the process of interest
  - *{{{color(indianred,Epistemic)}}}* uncertainty
  - Improved models or measurements could reduce it
* Aleatory uncertainty
  Variability - Randomness

* Epistemic uncertainty
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
  - Predictions and analysis require *models*
  - /All models are wrong, but some are useful/
  - Reducible uncertainty as more knowledge is gained
** Example
  #+reveal_html: <div class="twocolumn"><div>
  [[file:images/cantilever_beam.png]]
  #+reveal_html: </div><div>
  $$ \Delta_B = \dfrac{P L^3}{3 E I}$$
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (roll-in)
  - Material is linearly elastic
  - Beam remains plane under load $P$
  - Support of the beam at point $A$ is perfectly rigid

* Decision making under uncertainty
  - No single observation is representative of the system
  - Evaluation or predictions are based on imperfect models
  - Statistics allow us to describe the /unavoidable/ uncertainty
  - Make decisions based on trade offs (cost, benefit etc.)
