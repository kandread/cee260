* Confidence interval
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - {{{color(steelblue, An interval estimate for a population parameter)}}}
  - Usually they are 90%, 95% and 99%
  - Measure of *reliability*: if we repeated the experiment multiple times and calculated the 95% bounds then 95% of samples would contain the true mean within their corresponding bounds
  - Confidence interval for mean, variance and proportion
  - Cases of normal distribution with known or unknown variance
* Confidence interval on the mean of a Normal distribution, variance known

  If $\overline{x}$ is the sample mean of a random sample of size $n$ from a normal population with known variance $\sigma^2$, a $100(1-a)\%$ confidence interval on $\mu$ is given by $$\overline{x}-z_{a / 2} \sigma / \sqrt{n} \leq \mu \leq \overline{x} + z_{a / 2} \sigma / \sqrt{n}$$

** Example
   - Ten measurements of impact energy on specimens of steel materials had a mean of 64.46 J
   - Impact energy is normally distributed with $\sigma=1$ J
   - What is the 95% confidence interval?
* Interpreting a confidence interval
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - Probability of $\mu$ being within the CI we calculated?
  - Subtle difference between probability and confidence
  - The CI is itself a *random interval*

  [[file:images/fig17_3.png]]
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  We can choose sample size $n$ so that we are $100(1-a)%$ confident that the error is less than $E$

* Sample size for specified error on the mean
  #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
  If $\overline{x}$ is used as an estimate of $\mu$, we can be $100(1-a)%$ confident that the error $|\overline{x}-\mu|$ will not exceed $E$ when the sample size is $$n=\left( \dfrac{z_{a/2}\sigma}{E} \right)^2$$

** Example
   How many steel material specimens do we need to keep the 95% bounds at most 1.0 J?
* One-sided confidence bounds
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - Two-sided confidence intervals
  - Sometimes we only care about the lower or upper bound only
  - For example, in material strength only the lower limit of the mean is important
** One-sided confidence bound on mean, variance known
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   A $100(1-a)%$ upper confidence bound for $\mu$ is $$\mu \leq \overline{x}+z_{a} \sigma / \sqrt{n}$$
   and a $100(1-a)%$ lower confidence bound for $\mu$ is $$\mu \geq \overline{x}-z_{a} \sigma / \sqrt{n}$$

*** Example
    What is the 95% lower bound of the mean impact energy?
* Problem 17.1
  The average speed of vehicles on a highway is being studied. Observations on 50 vehicles yielded a mean of 65 mph. Assume that the standard deviation is known to be 6 mph. What is the 2-sided 99% confidence interval on the mean speed?
  #+reveal: split
  How many additional vehicles need to be observed so that the mean speed can be estimated within $\pm 1$ mph with 99% confidence?
  #+reveal: split
  If two engineers collect data and each one separately observes 10 vehicles, what is the probability that Engineer 1 will have a sample mean larger than Engineer's 2 by 2 mph?
  #+reveal: split
  What if the two engineers observed 100 vehicles instead?
* What if $X$ does not have a normal distribution?
  #+reveal_html: <div class="fragment block">
  When $n$ is large the quantity $\dfrac{\overline{X}-\mu}{S / \sqrt{n}}$ has an approximate standard normal and therefore $$\overline{x}-z_{a/2} \dfrac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \mu \leq \overline{x} + z_{a/2} \dfrac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$ which is a large-sample confidence interval for $\mu$

* Confidence interval on the mean of a Normal distribution, variance unknown
  We replace the random variable $Z$ with $$T=\dfrac{\overline{X}-\mu}{S / \sqrt{n}}$$
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  We know that for large $n$ this is a normal distribution, but what about a smaller $n$?

* $t$ distribution
  #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
  Let $X_1$, $X_2$,..., $X_n$ be a random sample from a normal distribution with unknown mean and unknown variance. The random variable $$T=\dfrac{\overline{X}-\mu}{S / \sqrt{n}}$$ has a $t$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.

** $t$ probability density function
   $$f(x) = \dfrac{\Gamma [(k+1)/2]}{\sqrt{\pi k} \Gamma(k/2)} \dfrac{1}{[(x^2/k)+1]^{(k+1)/2}}$$
   $k$ is the degrees of freedom, the mean is zero and the variance is $k/(k-2)$

** $t$ confidence interval on $\mu$
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   If $\overline{x}$ and $s$ are the mean and standard deviation of a random sample from a normal distribution with unknown variance with unknown variance $\sigma^2$, a $100(1-a)%$ confidence interval on $\mu$ is given by
   $$\overline{x}-t_{a/2,n-1} s / \sqrt{n} \leq \mu \leq \overline{x}+t_{a/2,n-1} s / \sqrt{n}$$
   where $t_{a/2,n-1}$ is the upper $a/2$ point of the $t$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom.

   A sample of 25 rebars tested for yield strengths yielded $\overline{x}=37.5$ psi and $s=3.5$ psi. What is the 95% confidence interval for the mean yield strength?
