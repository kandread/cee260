* Problem 10.1
  Truck traffic on a highway can be described as a Poisson process with a mean arrival rate of 1 truck/minute. The weight of each truck is random, and the probability of being overloaded is 10%.
  #+reveal: split
  What is the probability that there will be at least two trucks in a 5-min period?
  #+reveal: split
  What is the probability that at most of the next 5 trucks will be overloaded?
  #+reveal: split
  What is the probability of overloaded trucks on the highway over a 30-min period?
* Continuous random variables
  #+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
  - A random variable with an interval of real numbers
  - Similar to discrete variables we describe them with
    - Probability density function $f(x)$
    - Cumulative distribution function $F(x)$
* Probability density function

** PDF properties
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   For a continuous random variable $X$, a probability density function is a function such that
   $$f(x) \geq 0$$
   $$ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)dx = 1$$
   $$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f(x)dx$$
   #+reveal_html: </div>
* Histogram
  - An approximation to a probability density function
  - For each interval of the histogram, the height represents the relative frequency of the measurements in that interval
  - The area under the curve over that interval represents the probability of the measurements in that interval

* Probabilities with PDFs
  $$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx$$
  #+reveal_html: <span class="fragment">
  $$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_{-\infty}^{b} f(x)dx - \int_{-\infty}^{a} f(x)dx$$
  #+reveal_html: </span>
* Cumulative distribution function
  #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
  The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a continuous random variable $X$ is
  $$F(x)=P(X \leq x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(u)du$$
  #+reveal_html: </div>
  for $-\infty < x < \infty$

** Estimating the PDF from the CDF
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   Given $F(x)$,
   $$f(x) = \dfrac{d F(x)}{dx}$$
   #+reveal_html: </div>
* Mean and variance of continuous variables
  #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
  Suppose that $X$ is a continuous random variable, then
  $$\mu=E(X)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x f(x) dx$$
  $$\sigma^2=V(X)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}(x-\mu)^2 f(x)dx = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^2f(x)dx - \mu^2$$
  #+reveal_html: </div>
** Expected value of a function of a continuous random variable
   #+reveal_html: <div class="block">
   If $X$ is a continuous random variable with PDF $f(x)$, then
   $$E[h(X)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(x)f(x)dx$$
   #+reveal_html: </div>
* Problem 10.2
  Suppose $X$ is a random variable defined as $$X=\dfrac{\text{final cost of project}}{\text{estimated cost of project}}$$ which has a PDF
  $$f(x)=\begin{cases} 0 & x<1 \\ 3/x^2 & 1 \leq x \leq a \\ 0 & x>1.5\end{cases}$$
  #+reveal: split
  What is the value of $a$?
  #+reveal: split
  What is the probability that the final cost of the project will exceed the estimated cost by 25%?
  #+reveal: split
  What is the mean value and standard deviation of $X$?
