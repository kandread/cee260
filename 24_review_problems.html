<h2 id="org401d887">Problem 1 (Set theory)</h2>
<p>
Records on winter weather for a town showed that there is a 20% chance of snow. In addition, low temperature (&lt;0 F) occurs on 5% of the days, whereas windy days occur 10% of the time. If temperature is low, the probability of snow on that day is increased to 30%. Let \(S\), \(C\), and \(W\) be the events of snow, low temperature and wind respectively. The even \(W\) can be assumed to be independent of \(S\) and \(C\).
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
What is the probability of having a day with all three events occurring?

Suppose a construction project cannot progress if it is windy or cold, but it is not affected by snow. What is the probability that construction work will be stopped on a given day?
</p>

<p>
On a day without snow, what is the probability that construction work cannot proceed?

<section>
<p>
What is the probability of a <i>nice weather day</i> (no snow, no wind, high temperature)?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
Suppose \(U\) is the event of uncomfortable wind chill condition on a given day. If either \(C\) or \(W\) (but not both) occurs, the probability of \(U\) is 50%, whereas if both \(C\) and \(W\) occur, the probability of \(U\) is 100%, and \(U\) will not occur if both \(C\) and \(W\) do not occur. What is the probability of the event \(U\) on a given day?

<h2 id="org8dd4c78">Problem 2 (Distributions)</h2>
<p>
The capacity of a pile supporting a transmission tower is modeled with a lognormal random variable with a mean of 100 tons and a c.o.v. of 20%.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
What is the probability that the pile will survive a load of 100 tons?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
During the installation of the pile, a pile load test indicated that the pile can support at least a load of 75 tons. What is now the probability that the pile will survive a 100-ton load?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
If the pile has survived a recent hurricane during which the load transmitted to the pile is estimated to be 90 tons, what is the probability that the pile can carry a 100-ton load?

<h2 id="orgd9bb8be">Problem 3 (Random functions)</h2>
<p>
A contractor submits bids to three highway jobs and two building jobs. The probability of winning each job is 0.6. The profit from a highway job is normally distributed as \(N(100,1600)\) in thousand dollars, whereas that for a building job is \(N(80,400)\) in thousand dollars. Assume that winning each job is an independent event and the profits between jobs are also statistically independent event.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
What is the probability that the contractor will win at least two jobs?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
What is the probability that they will win exactly one highway job but none of the building jobs?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
Suppose that they won two highway jobs and one building job. What is the probability that the total profit will exceed $300,000?
</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>
How would the previous answer change if the profit from the two highway jobs are correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0.8?

<h2 id="org1a34bac">Problem 4 (Expectation/Bias)</h2>
<p>
Variance is given by \[\sigma^2=E[(x-\mu)^2]\]
Prove that the sample variance estimate of \[s^2=\dfrac{1}{n} \sum (x - \overline{x})^2\] is a biased estimator of \(\sigma^2\). <i>Hint</i>: \((x-\overline{x})=(x-\mu-\overline{x}+\mu)\)
